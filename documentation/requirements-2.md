The X-Curve Visualization (Page 2)
What you draw: The decreasing responsibility vs increasing wealth curves What the app does: This should be an animated interactive chart — one of your killer presentation features. Client sees:
Left curve (red): Responsibilities declining over time (mortgage payoff, kids leave, etc.)
Right curve (green): Wealth accumulating
Crossover point highlighted with age
Insurance need area shaded between the curves
AI Enhancement: AI narrates: "Yashwanth, right now at 34 your responsibilities are at their peak — mortgage, young children, single income supporting the family. But as you approach 55-60, these responsibilities decrease while your wealth grows. The gap between these curves is exactly what insurance needs to cover."
3. Needs Calculation Engine (Page 2 bottom)
What you calculate by hand: F = 2×3×800×365×20 = 940K, I = 1200×12×15×20 = 300K, etc. What the app does: Deterministic computation engine with component breakdown:
Insurance Needs Calculator:
├── F (Food/Living):     Family size × meals × cost × 365 × years = $940,000
├── I (Income Replace):  Monthly × 12 × factor × years          = $300,000  
├── M (Mortgage):        Payment × years                         = $200,000
├── E (Education):       Annual × 12 × cost × years              = $300,000 (30M seems like a discussion number)
├── F (Final Expenses):  Estimated                                = $15K
├── TOTAL NEED:          ~$4.7M over 20 years
├── MINUS existing:      Term 1M/30Y
└── GAP:                 ~$3.7M
AI Enhancement: AI doesn't compute — it explains: "Your family needs approximately $4.7 million in coverage over 20 years. Here's why: feeding a family of 4 for 20 years alone costs nearly $1M. Add income replacement, mortgage payoff, and education funding, and the number adds up fast. Your existing $1M term policy covers only about 21% of this need."
4. Tax Bucket Strategy (Page 3)
What you draw: The triangle with Now/Later/Advantaged What the app does: Interactive tax bucket visualization:
Tax Buckets:
├── 🔴 TAX NOW (Taxable):     Brokerage, savings, CDs, bonds
├── 🟡 TAX LATER (Deferred):  401K, Traditional IRA → RMD at 73!
└── 🟢 TAX ADVANTAGED:        Roth IRA, 7702/CVL → No tax in future, No RMD
    
Monthly Expense Breakdown: $12,800/mo
├── Health Insurance: $4,400
├── Mortgage:         $1,000  
├── Daily Living:     $3,000
├── Education:        $3,500
└── Miscellaneous:    $1,000
AI Enhancement: "Right now, 100% of your retirement savings are in the 'Tax Later' bucket (401K). This means every dollar you withdraw in retirement will be taxed as income. By diversifying into Tax-Advantaged vehicles like a Roth IRA or 7702-compliant policy, you create tax-free income streams AND avoid Required Minimum Distributions at age 73."
5. Roth vs 7702 Comparison (Page 3)
What you write: Side-by-side eligibility, 59½ rules, RMD rules What the app does: Clean comparison table auto-generated based on client's income:
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────────┐
│                  │ Roth IRA     │ 7702 (CVL/IUL)   │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────────┤
│ Eligibility     │ Income limit │ No limit          │
│ 59½ Rule        │ Yes          │ No                │
│ 10% Penalty     │ Yes (early)  │ No                │
│ RMD at 73       │ No (Roth)    │ No                │
│ Tax-Free Growth │ Yes          │ Yes               │
│ Tax-Free Income │ Yes          │ Yes               │
│ Death Benefit   │ No           │ Yes               │
│ Living Benefits │ No           │ Yes (CI, chronic) │
│ Downside Protect│ No           │ Yes (floor)       │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────────┘
6. College Education Planning (Page 4)
What you calculate: $300/month → $3,600/year → 60K → grows to 120K What the app does:
College Funding Module:
├── 529 Plan: $300/mo × 17 years → $61,200 contributed → ~$120K projected
├── FAFSA Impact: Warning about 529 affecting financial aid eligibility
├── CVL Alternative: Cash value life as college funding vehicle
├── Scholarship scenario: If full scholarship → funds repurpose to retirement
└── No scholarship scenario: Covers ~2 years at state university
7. Pension/Annuity Strategy (Page 4 bottom)
What you draw: 401K → X$ → distribute → deplete vs Guaranteed Lifetime Income What the app does: This is your annuity optimization module:
Retirement Income Comparison:
├── Scenario A: 401K → Systematic withdrawal → DEPLETES at age [X]
│   Risk: Market downturn + longevity = run out of money
│   
├── Scenario B: 401K → Rollover → Fixed Index Annuity
│   ├── Guaranteed Lifetime Income (private pension)
│   ├── Downside protection (0% floor)
│   ├── Upside participation (cap/spread)
│   └── Never depletes regardless of market
│
└── Old 401K Options:
    ├── Roll to new employer 401K (consolidation, watch fees)
    ├── Keep at old employer (multiple accounts to manage)
    ├── Roll to Traditional IRA → stocks (market risk)
    ├── Cash out → 10% penalty + income tax (WORST option)
    └── Roll to SD IRA → FIA (recommended path shown)
AI Enhancement: "Think of this as building your own private pension. Your old 401K sitting with a previous employer is doing nothing special. By rolling it into a Fixed Index Annuity inside an IRA, you convert an uncertain balance into a guaranteed lifetime income stream — similar to what your parents' generation had with company pensions, but one you control."
8. Recommendation Summary (Page 5)
