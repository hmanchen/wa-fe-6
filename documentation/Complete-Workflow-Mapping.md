# WealthArchitect — Workflow Mapped to Your Manual FNA Process
## The App Digitizes YOUR Paper Process. AI Makes It Better.

---

## THE SIMPLE TRUTH

Your manual FNA works. You do it on paper. Clients buy products. The app should do EXACTLY what your paper does — but faster, more impressive, and with AI detecting things you might miss.

**Your paper FNA has 5 pages. The app has 8 tabs because some pages split into input vs output.**

Here's the direct mapping:

```

## PAGE-BY-PAGE: WHAT YOU DO ON PAPER → WHAT THE APP DOES → WHERE AI ADDS VALUE

---

### 📄 PAGE 1 — DISCOVERY & GOALS

#### What you do on paper:
- Write down client name, age, spouse, kids
- Ask about goals: Growth, Income, No Risk/No Loss, Taxes, Accessibility, Legacy
- Capture: Time Horizon, Risk Tolerance, Suitability, Affordability
- Note down: 401(k) details (10%, pre-tax, growth), employer match, spouse retirement status
- Check off: Term insurance (1M/30Y), Mortgage, Brokerage, Roth IRA, Pension (0), College (0), Real Estate
- Note long-term care consideration

#### What the app does (Tab 1: Financial Background):
**Same questions, digital form.** 6 sub-sections:
1. **Employment & Income** — Client + spouse jobs, salaries, other income
2. **Retirement Accounts** — 401(k) details (balance, contribution %, match, loan), Roth, IRA, HSA, pension
3. **Investments & Assets** — Brokerage, stocks/RSUs, crypto, real estate, property in India
4. **Real Estate** — Primary home value + mortgage, rental properties
5. **Debts** — Credit cards, HELOC, personal loans, 401(k) loans, informal/hand loans
6. **Monthly Expenses** — Housing, utilities, food, education, insurance premiums, everything

**What you can't do on paper that the app does:**
- Health Score updates LIVE as you enter data (sidebar gauge: 42/100)
- Net worth calculates automatically as you enter assets and debts
- Monthly surplus/deficit shows immediately after income and expenses

#### 🤖 WHERE AI ADDS VALUE (Tab 1):

| AI Call | What It Does | Who Sees It | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Gap Detection Hints** | As you enter data, AI spots things: "401(k) at 10%, match is 0% — no free money being left on table" or "Spouse has $0 retirement — major gap" or "No college savings, kids are 5 and 3 — clock is ticking" | **Advisor only** (💡 icon) | Helps you catch things you might miss. On paper, you might forget to ask about HSA or disability. The AI reminds you. |

**What the client sees on this tab:** Just the form being filled out + health score updating. Professional. Clean. The client thinks "this is thorough."

---

#### What the app does (Tab 2: Income Replacement Risk):

This is NEW — you don't have this on paper. It's a 2-minute animated story that shows:

```
Step 1: "Yashwanth earns $185,000/year. That's $15,400/month supporting the family."
Step 2: "If something happens to Yashwanth tomorrow..."
Step 3: "Snigdha has $0 income. Mortgage is $2,800/month. Kids need school."
Step 4: "The $1M term policy covers ~5 years. Then what?"
Step 5: "This is why we need to look at your full protection picture."
```

**No AI needed.** Simple animation using the client's own numbers from Tab 1. But it's POWERFUL — the client sees their own name, their own income disappearing. This is the emotional hook before you ask about insurance on Tab 3.

**AI calls: ZERO. Cost: $0.**

---

### 📄 PAGE 2 — NEEDS ANALYSIS, X-CURVE & ESTATE

#### What you do on paper:
- Draw the house foundation diagram (assets as foundation, debts as cracks)
- Draw the X-Curve (decreasing responsibility vs increasing wealth)
- Calculate insurance needs by hand:
  ```
  F (Food/Living):     2 × 3 × 800 × 365 × 20 = $940,000
  I (Income Replace):  1,200 × 12 × 15 × 20    = $300,000
  M (Mortgage):        10,000 × 20               = $200,000
  E (Education):       150,000 × 20              = $30M (discussion)
  TOTAL:               ~$4.7M over 20 years
  MINUS existing:      Term $1M/30Y
  GAP:                 ~$3.7M
  ```
- Note estate documents needed: Will, Probate, Trust, POA
- Note disability, critical illness, cash benefits

#### What the app does — this maps to THREE tabs:

**Tab 3: Protection & Estate (INPUT)**
- Enter existing insurance policies (Term $1M/30Y, group, etc.)
- Enter disability status (has/doesn't have)
- Enter estate documents (Will ❌, Trust ❌, POA ❌, HCD ❌)

**Tab 4: Analysis Dashboard (THE REVEAL)**
- All computation engines run — net worth, cash flow, debt, health score
- Client sees their score for the first time: "42/100 — Needs Attention"
- Visual cards: Net Worth, Tax Mix, Coverage Gap

**Tab 5: Financial Home (THE DEEP DIVE)**
- AI explains WHY the score is 42
- Cash flow breakdown: Gross → Taxes → Take-Home → Expenses → Surplus/Deficit
- Debt overview (if applicable): tiers, interest cost, strategy
- Protection status: "Coverage: $1M of $4.7M need = 21% covered"
- Estate checklist: Will ❌ Trust ❌ POA ❌ — "Estimated probate cost: $45K-$126K"

#### 🤖 WHERE AI ADDS VALUE (Tabs 3, 4, 5):

| Tab | AI Call | What It Does | Who Sees It |
|-----|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tab 3** | Protection Gap Alerts | "🔴 Coverage is only 5.4× income — standard is 10-15×" and "🔴 No disability insurance — single earner family" | **Client sees** — these appear as system-generated alerts, not the advisor selling |
| **Tab 3** | Estate Urgency | "With 2 children under 10 and no will, the state of Texas decides who raises them" + probate cost estimate | **Client sees** — creates urgency for will & trust |
| **Tab 4** | NONE | Pure computation. Health score, net worth, tax — all math, no AI | **Client sees** numbers only |
| **Tab 5** | Executive Summary | "Yashwanth, you and Snigdha have built a solid foundation — stable income at $260K, home ownership, 401(k) underway. However, your family has a $3.7M protection gap..." (2-3 paragraphs) | **Client sees** — this is the "story" version of Tab 4's numbers |
| **Tab 5** | Health Score Explanation | "Your score of 42/100 reflects strong savings but critical gaps in protection and estate planning" | **Client sees** |
| **Tab 5** | Debt Strategy | ONLY for clients with heavy debt: "Your credit card debt is costing $14K/year in interest. Here's a 30-month plan to eliminate it." | **Client sees** (only if applicable) |

**KEY DIFFERENTIATOR:** On paper, you calculate $4.7M by hand and the client sees your handwriting. In the app, the computation engine does it instantly, AI explains it in a personalized narrative, and it looks professional. The client trusts the system's analysis more than handwritten math.

### 📄 PAGE 2 (continued) — THE X-CURVE + 📄 PAGE 3 — TAX BUCKETS + 📄 PAGE 4 — COLLEGE & PENSION

#### What you do on paper:
- **Draw the X-Curve** (red line going down = responsibilities, green line going up = wealth, crossover point)
- **Calculate needs**: F + I + M + E + Final = $4.7M, minus $1M existing = $3.7M gap
- **Draw the tax triangle**: Now (taxable) / Later (401k, IRA) / Advantaged (Roth, 7702)
- **Write Roth vs 7702 comparison**: eligibility, 59½, RMD, penalty
- **Calculate monthly retirement expenses**: HI $4,400 + M $1,000 + D $3,000 + E $3,500 + ME $1,000 = ~$12,800
- **Calculate college**: $300/mo → $3,600/yr → 60K → grows to 120K. Note 529, FAFSA, scholarship risk
- **Draw pension diagram**: 401(k) → distribute → deplete vs 401(k) → FIA → guaranteed lifetime income
- **List old 401(k) rollover options**: new employer, keep, IRA→stocks, cash out (worst), SD IRA→FIA

#### What the app does (Tab 6: Financial X Curve):

This is your PRESENTATION tab — the centerpiece of the client meeting. It's ONE scrollable page with 4 sections that match your paper pages 2, 3, and 4:

#### 🤖 WHERE AI ADDS VALUE (Tab 6):

| AI Call | What It Does | Who Sees It |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **X-Curve Narration** | After the chart animation, AI generates: "Yashwanth, this chart tells the story of your family's financial journey. At 34, your responsibilities are at their peak — mortgage, young children, single income. As you approach 55-60, these decrease while your wealth grows. The shaded area is exactly what insurance covers. Your current $1M term covers only 21% of this gap." | **Client sees** — advisor reads this aloud or lets client read |
| **Tax Strategy Narrative** | "Right now, 80% of your retirement savings sit in the Tax Later bucket. Every dollar you withdraw will be taxed at your income rate. By diversifying into a 7702-compliant policy, you create tax-free income AND avoid RMDs at 73." | **Client sees** |

**No AI for College or Pension sections** — the computation data (529 projection, rollover penalty, FIA comparison) speaks for itself. Advisor narrates verbally. This saves cost and keeps the focus on the numbers.

### 📄 PAGE 5 — RECOMMENDATIONS

#### What you do on paper:
- Write priority list:
  ```
  ① CVL (Cash Value Life / IUL) — $1.5M
  ② Gap fill → 2.5M + SDIC
  ③ College → $300/month
  ④ $10K → FIA + LTI (Long Term Income)
  ⑤ JVM (investment review)
  ```
- Draw the insurance triangle (1.5M top, S→1M, allocations)
- Note the underwriting process: SSN→MIB, DL→MVR, medicals, documents, in-force, sign

#### What the app does (Tab 7: Recommendations):

**THE GOAL: Show the client what to buy, why, how it's funded, and what happens if they don't.**

The app shows TWO different layouts depending on the client's situation:

**IF client has positive cash flow (standard client like Yashwanth):**

**IF client has heavy debt (like Raj Patel with $100K credit cards):**

The app AUTOMATICALLY detects this and shows PHASES instead of TIERS:

```
⚠️ "We're NOT recommending insurance today. Your $100K credit card 
debt at 22% is consuming $22K/year in interest. We eliminate that 
first, THEN build protection with the $4,980/month that frees up."

PHASE 1: Stop the Bleeding (Now → Month 12)
PHASE 2: Build Basic Protection (Month 12-24)
PHASE 3: Full Financial Plan (Month 24+)
```

This is what makes WealthArchitect different — it knows when NOT to sell. That builds trust. The client comes back in 12 months ready to buy because the advisor didn't push products on a drowning person.

#### 🤖 WHERE AI ADDS VALUE (Tab 7):

|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Full Recommendations** | Generates the ENTIRE recommendation package: money found narrative, per-product explanations (WHY this product, HOW it's funded, WHAT happens if you don't), tier/phase descriptions, transformation projections, next steps | **Client sees** — this is the closing presentation | This one AI call generates the content that sells the products. It's personalized to THIS client's exact situation. Worth every penny. |

**On-demand (client clicks buttons):**

## THE COMPLETE AI MAP — SIMPLE VERSION

### Where AI runs and what it does:

```
Tab 1: Financial Background
  └── 🤖 Gap hints for advisor (💡 panel)           ← Catches things you'd miss
       "Spouse has $0 retirement"
       "No disability insurance"
       "401(k) above match is redirectable money"

Tab 2: Income Replacement Risk
  └── No AI. Animated story using client's own numbers.

Tab 3: Protection & Estate
  ├── 🤖 Protection gap alerts (client sees)         ← Objective system finding issues
  │    "🔴 Coverage is 5.4× income — standard is 10-15×"
  └── 🤖 Estate urgency narrative (client sees)      ← Creates urgency for Will & Trust
       "No will + 2 minor children = court decides guardianship"

Tab 4: Analysis Dashboard
  └── No AI. Pure computation. Instant reveal.        ← Speed matters here

Tab 5: Financial Home
  ├── 🤖 Executive summary (client sees)              ← "The story" of their finances
  ├── 🤖 Health score explanation (client sees)        ← Why their score is what it is
  ├── 🤖 Strengths & gaps (client sees)                ← Balanced view
  ├── 🤖 Protection alerts (client sees)               ← Specific risks
  └── 🤖 Debt strategy (IF heavy debt — client sees)   ← Payoff plan + countdown

Tab 6: Financial X Curve
  ├── 🤖 X-Curve narration (client sees)               ← Explains the chart
  │    "This gap is what insurance covers..."
  └── 🤖 Tax strategy narrative (client sees)           ← Explains the buckets
       "80% in Tax Later means every dollar taxed..."

Tab 7: Recommendations
  └── 🤖 FULL RECOMMENDATION PACK (client sees)        ← THE CLOSER
       Money found, product recommendations,
       tier descriptions, transformation table,
       next steps — all personalized

Tab 8: Delivery
  └── No AI. PDF from stored results.
```

## WHY THIS IS A PRODUCT PEOPLE WILL PAY FOR

### What you do today (paper):
- 45-60 minute meeting
- Handwritten calculations (client might not trust the math)
- No visual impact (hand-drawn X-curve)
- No professional deliverable (photocopied paper)
- Miss gaps (you're human, you might forget to ask about disability)
- Same presentation for every client
- No follow-up tool

### What the app does:
- **AI catches gaps you miss** — "Spouse has $0 retirement" appears before you even think to ask
- **Animated X-Curve** — client watches their gap appear on screen. Way more impactful than a hand-drawn chart
- **Exact calculations** — $4,702,400 total need computed instantly, not "approximately $4.7M by hand"
- **Professional PDF** — 12-page branded report emailed to client. They show their spouse. They come back
- **Personalized AI narratives** — "Yashwanth, your family needs..." not generic scripts
- **Automatic debt detection** — knows when NOT to sell insurance (builds trust → client returns)
- **Multi-language** — Telugu, Spanish, Chinese narratives. The client reads their own language
- **Transformation table** — client sees "If I do Tier 1, my score goes from 42 to 58 for $0 new cost." They choose a tier and sign
- **Compliance-safe** — every projection has 3 scenarios + disclaimers. You're protected

### The killer differentiator:
**The system finds money the client didn't know they had.** "Your 401(k) contribution above the employer match — that $1,125/month — can be redirected to an IUL that gives you tax-free income + death benefit + living benefits. Same dollar, 3× the value." 

That's not something you can do with a pen and paper in a 45-minute meeting. That's AI + computation working together.
